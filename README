This tool retrieves the shared secret computed during the Diffie Hellman exchange
in SSH communications.
This only works if one of the two ends uses OpenSSH and was vulnerable to the Debian 
OpenSSL PRNG vulnerability.

To use it you have to extract the parameters yourself from a session and pass them on the command line.

If the client is vulnerable you will need :
	- the public key (from the DH) sent by the client
	- the DH group information : p and g (sent by the server, or defined in the RFC)
	- the private key size (derived from the ciphers and hmac key/block sizes, multiplied by 2, usually 256 or 512 bits)

If the server is vulnerable and uses DSA, you will need the same information.
If the server is vulnerable and uses RSA, you will need the same information plus the RSA host key modulus .

Check samples.txt to see how to parse the infos.

The real encryption key is derived from all the informations exchanged before starting the encryption.
You'll have to develop that part yourself (check kexdh.c in openssh)

OpenSSL patch is against this version :
